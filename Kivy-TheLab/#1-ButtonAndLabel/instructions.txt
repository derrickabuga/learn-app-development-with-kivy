**IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE!**
=============================
1. In your '.kv' file, in order to change the text
color of a label or button, use the following syntax:
    Button:
        color: r, g, b, a
        **where:
        r, g, b, a are the red, green, blue, and alpha
        values from 0 to 1 respectively**

2. We use "dp" as the units for measurement when
specifying button and label size as well as position
**where dp stands for density-independent pixels**
For example, 40 x 40dp is the size of a finger click.
